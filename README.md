# running-data-api
My first original api. It's simple, and isn't quite complete yet, but it works. 10 years of running data in an api. My 1st goal was just to funnel my postgres data to be viewed in the browser in json. I know I'll look back and laugh at how trivial this is, but for my frist time, I'm pretty excited!

The Nike Run Club (formerly NikePlus) app on iphone used to have an accessible api so users could retrieve their running data.
I've looked everywhere and apparently it no longer exists. So I created an SQL file and went through every run on my for from the past 10 years. 1108 lines - and counting - in total. Using that SQL file, I created a postgres database, and that is what I'm using to store the api data. 

Maybe, if anyone becomes interested I will make it available as a sample data set. I'm just now learning this crazy api creation/consumption stuff, and I think it is super cool!
